# SIH-Alpha
1. A web application platform, powered by Next.js and React for frontend development and utilizing TailwindCSS for design, is designed to facilitate connections between patients and doctors. Python is employed for backend development.
2. Utilizing OpenCV for facial recognition to efficiently assess the availability of doctors within the system.

3. Implementing cutting-edge NLP techniques to offer doctor recommendations tailored to users' specific health issues, factoring in drug reactions and symptoms. The tech stack includes Python, Natural Language Processing libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy), and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.

4. Implementing a real-time database system using a robust RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) like PostgreSQL or MySQL to seamlessly update and maintain doctor availability. This database will be integrated with the web application using SQL or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like SQLAlchemy for Python.
